# NoBarkStripping
A very simply plugin that prevents people from stripping logs and wood with an axe. Instead, they can craft the wood/logs together with an axe to create the stripped wood and logs, respectively.

The reason for this plugin was too many people used this feature in minecraft to grief others. Because it's so simple to do, and because it creates so much anguish for other players, players love to use this vanilla feature to troll. This plugin stops the ability to do so without them having to break the blocks, strip the logs/wood, then replace them. 

## Notes
Attempting to strip a log multiple times with an axe will send a player a message letting them know that they must craft stripped logs instead. The message is configurable.

## Config
```yml
attempted-strip-message: '&cYou must craft logs and an axe together if you want to strip logs!'
```
